# Brix

"Brix" is a simple project that aims to recreate the Brick Breaker game. The idea for this project was inspired by the website GeeksForGeeks, which recommended it as a beginner-friendly project. The game will be implemented entirely in Java and will utilize the libGDX framework for handling graphics.
